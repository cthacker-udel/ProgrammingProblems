He wants to invest his USD $10,000 savings in these three accounts

he knows that **after a year he would receive a total of US $ 260 in interest** if he put **twice as much money in the savings account as in the CDs**, and **“z” money in bonds**.

x = money in cds
z = money in bonds

2x + x + z = 260

3x + z = 260
z = 260 - 3x

a + b + z = 10000
2a + b + z = 260

a + b/2 + z/2 = 130

- -a -b -z = -10000

---

       -b/2 -z/2 = -9870

-b/2 - z/2 = -9870

-.5b - .5z = -9870
